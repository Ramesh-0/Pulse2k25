# PULSE.exe 2k25

Pulse.exe 2k25 is a simple and interactive website I built using React.js for our college departmental event. It’s designed to give participants all the info they need in one place — from a quick intro to the event, to the full schedule, details about the organizers, and how to reach out for help.

The highlight of the project is the Room Allotment feature. After making their payment, participants receive a bill number. By entering that number on the site, they can instantly see their assigned room, payment status, and team name. This feature was super handy and used by more than 150 students, helping us manage everything smoothly.
